# SASS React Scaffold

A simple react scaffold or template so you can start building your react app. The scaffold is built using create-react-app and is configured to use SASS files.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo and run yarn install or npm install. Once you run yarn start or npm start, the page should have a pink color at the top. That means the SASS file is working.
